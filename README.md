# Omarchy-Okonomi
---  
##-=[ NOTE ]=-
This is no longer under active development as of Omarchy 4+.  
The features I was wanting and the reason for this repo are now part of Omarchy config options.
I will archive this for my own history and development.
---  

### Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to add setup choices on top of Omarchy to fit your needs. Your choices should be applied to a fresh, upgraded base install of Omarchy.

Omarchy is based on the concept of "Opinionated Arch Linux", taking inspiration from the Japanese word *Omakase* (お任せ), meaning "I'll leave it up to you" or "Chef's choice".  
This repo flips that and starts with Omarchy, then adds some choice into the mix.  

*i.e.*, *Okonomi* (お好み), meaning "as you like" or "Customer's choice".  

Therefore, this is **Omarchy-Okonomi** ("Customer's choice" not "Chef's choice").

### Key Justifications
- I'm not a developer, so some of Omarchy's default applications I don't use day-to-day.
- I like the idea of installing a setup Arch system, but want my defaults applied post-install:
  - Removing apps I don't use.
  - Adding apps I do use.
  - Tweaking some keybindings.
  - Tweaking some configs.

### Instructions
1. Install Omarchy.
2. Perform a system update (using the built-in Omarchy update).
3. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nzkritik/omarchy-okonomi.git
   cd omarchy-okonomi
   ```
4. (Optional) Review the files and customize to suit your needs.
5. Run the install script:  
   ```bash
   ./install-all.sh
   ```
6. Select the options you want and let the system install them for you.
7. Reboot your system and enjoy! 🚀
